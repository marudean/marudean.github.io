                    <div style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;">
                        EPS stands for Expandable Polystyrene System. It is one kind of the new technology to produce carbon frames.<br>                        When we use the traditional technology to produce carbon frames, we need to make the material into
                        separate pieces during the layup.<br> However, using EPS process allows us to make carbon frames
                        in one piece and make them lighter and stronger.<br> EPS production process is in an effort to both
                        increase rigidity and safeness as well as to decrease the overall weight of the frame.<br> Increased
                        compaction will makes frames more rigid which allows the riders to have greater control of the bike
                        and lose less energy due to frame flex laterally.

                    <div style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;">
                        The EPS process will eliminate extra and unnecessary materials for our carbon frames while the compaction of carbon layers
                        is optimized;<br> therefore, it will translate into an overall weight savings.<br>                        This process also eliminates small imperfections as the result of traditional frame production methods.<br>                        These imperfections are often the causes of structural failure and they will increas the risk for
                        riders.<br> By eliminating these structural imperfections through EPS process, our carbon frames
                        have improved the safety and been above the industry standard.

                    <div style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;">
                        The EPS system consists in laminating carbon sheets around Polystyrene forms, with perfectly smooth surfaces,<br>                        and leaving these forms inside the mold during the pressure phase of production.<br> The mold expands
                        both due to increased heat; in addition to added air pressure leaving a controlled and optimized
                        thickness of carbon material<br> throughout the frame. The polystyrene mold is then removed when
                        the production process is completed.
