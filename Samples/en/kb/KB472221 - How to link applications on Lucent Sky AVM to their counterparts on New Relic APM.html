        This article describes how to link applications on Lucent Sky AVM to their counterparts on New Relic APM. After the project is linked to an application, you can navigate to your New Relic dashboard for the project directly from Lucent Sky AVM Web UI.

        There are two ways to link applications on Lucent Sky AVM to applications on New Relic APM, one is to automatically link all applications at system level and one is to manually link individual applications at application level.
    </p>
    <p>
        To automatically link all applications on Lucent Sky AVM to their counterparts on New Relic APM:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            On <a href="https://rpm.newrelic.com" target="_blank">https://rpm.newrelic.com</a>, log into your New Relic account. This should take you to your application list. Note the URL in your browser, which is something similar to <strong>https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/<em>123456</em></strong>, where <em>123456</em> is your Account ID.
        </li>
        <li>
            On Lucent Sky AVM Web UI, go to <strong>Integration Settings</strong> by clicking <strong>Settings</strong> at upper-left, then click <strong>Integration</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Under <strong>New Relic APM</strong>, fill in the account ID from step 1, and then click <strong>Sync</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lucent Sky AVM will try to match all existing applications with their counterparts on New Relic APM. New applications created in the future on Lucent Sky AVM will also be matched.
        </li>
        <li>
            For applications that can't be automatically matched, you can also manually link them. You can also manually remove the link for applications that were automatically matched.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        To link an individual Lucent Sky AVM application to a New Relic APM application:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            On <a href="https://rpm.newrelic.com" target="_blank">https://rpm.newrelic.com</a>, log into your New Relic account. This should take you to your application list. Click on the application you want to link with a Lucent Sky AVM project. Note the URL in your browser, which is something similar to <strong>https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/<em>123456</em>/applications/<em>7654321</em></strong>, where <em>123456</em> is your Account ID and <em>7654321</em> is your Application ID.
        </li>
        <li>
            On Lucent Sky AVM Web UI, go to the application list by clicking the Lucent Sky AVM logo at the upper-left.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hover your mouse cursor over the application you want to link. Click the <strong>APM</strong> icon.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the pop-up window, enter your Account ID in <strong>New Relic Account ID</strong> and your Application ID in <strong>New Relic Application ID</strong>, and the click <strong>Save</strong>.
        </li>
    </ol>
