        Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
        Lucent Sky AVM is a system that helps developers and other stakeholders identify and automatically mitigate vulnerabilities in an application's source code. Lucent Sky AVM is composed of three components, CLEAR Engine (the core analysis and mitigation engine), Web UI, and Developer UIs. The Developer UIs include CLI, Visual Studio Extension and Eclipse plug-in.

        Prerequisites for Administrators
    </h2>
    <p>
        Administrators should be familiar with the management and operation of the following systems and tools:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    CLEAR Engine and all kinds of AVM interfaces communicate through WCF, via named pipes, TCP and optionally other WCF channels.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    CLEAR Engine runs as a Windows Service and Web UI runs on Internet Information Services (IIS). You might need to change settings of Windows Firewall to allow communications between CLEAR Engine and Lucent Sky AVM's various interfaces.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        At the end of this section, you will be able to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Install CLEAR Engine on your server, and install and set up Microsoft SQL Server for it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Install Lucent Sky Web UI on your server, and set up Internet Information Services (IIS) for it.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>To install CLEAR Engine and Web UI</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Double-click on the Lucent Sky AVM server setup file (<strong>CLEAR_x64.exe</strong>). The file will automatically extract and create a <strong>CLEAR_x64</strong> folder at the location of your choice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Open the folder and double-click the file Setup. The setup program will launch.
            <ul>
                <li>

                    <strong>License</strong> – Review the end-user licensing agreement (EULA), and then click <strong>Agree</strong> if you agree the EULA, or click <strong>Decline</strong> to exit the setup program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Activation</strong> – Enter the product key provided to you, and then click <strong>Activate License</strong>. If the server doesn't have Internet access, or you're re-running the setup program and have already activated a license, click <strong>Skip Activation</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Prerequisites</strong> – Make sure that .NET Framework 3.5, .NET Framework 4.0/4.5 and Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0 or higher have been installed on the server. If you want to install and setup a new SQL Server Express instance for CLEAR Engine, click <strong>Install SQL Server</strong>. If you want to setup an existing SQL Server instance for CLEAR Engine, click <strong>Use Existing Database</strong>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Install SQL Server</strong> – Click <strong>Launch SQL Server Setup</strong> to launch the setup program of SQL Server Express. Follow the setup program to install SQL Server Express, and the setup parameters have been preconfigured so you should be able to accept the default configurations. When the installation is completed, go back to the AVM Server setup program, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Setup SQL Server</strong> – Enter the FQDN, IP address, or the computer name, and instance name in <strong>SQL Server</strong> (for example, <em>sqlserver.contoso.com\AVMSQL</em>, where <em>sqlserver.contoso.com</em> is the FQDN of the SQL Server, and <em>AVMSQL</em> is the instance name), select the security model, as well as username and password if necessary, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Install CLEAR Engine</strong> – Accept the default location for storing application repository, or choose a custom location, and then click <strong>Next</strong>. The AVM Server setup program will become unresponsive for roughly 30 to 60 seconds during this process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Install Web UI</strong> – To install Web UI on the same server, enter the FQDN or IP that users will be accessing Web UI through in <strong>Web UI FQDN</strong> or <strong>IP address</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>. To install Web UI on another server or to skip its installation, click <strong>Skip</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Complete</strong> – The AVM Server setup has completed.
