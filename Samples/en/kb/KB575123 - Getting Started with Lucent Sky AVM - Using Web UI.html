        Introduction
    </h1>
    <p>
        Lucent Sky AVM is a system that helps developers and other stakeholders identify and automatically mitigate vulnerabilities in an application's source code. Lucent Sky AVM is composed of three components, CLEAR Engine (the core analysis and mitigation engine), Web UI, and Developer UIs. The Developer UIs include CLI, Visual Studio Extension and Eclipse plug-in.

    <p>
        Developers should be familiar with the following tools:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>C#, Java or VB.NET languages</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This guide uses C# (which has a similar syntax with Java and VB.NET) in its examples and screenshots.
                </li>

            <strong>.NET Web Applications</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In File Explorer, go to the root of the solution that contains the web application you want to secure. The root of the solution usually has the file <em>ContosoWeb.sln</em>, where <em>ContosoWeb</em> is the name of the solution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select all directories and files, except for those belong to web applications other than the one you want to secure. You may also unselect non-code files, such as images and videos.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Right click on the selected files, move the mouse cursor over <strong>Send to</strong>, then click <strong>Compressed (zipped) folder</strong>. Or use your preferred archive program (such as 7-Zip) to create an archive in zip format.

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>To scan an application for vulnerabilities</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Go to the Web UI in your browser, and then sign in with your credentials.
        </li>
        <li>
            Under the Action Bar on the left, click <strong>New Application</strong>. Enter a descriptive name of the application to be scanned in <strong>Application Name</strong>, select the application framework, and then click <strong>Create</strong>. You can also optionally change the default analysis and mitigation parameters for this application by clicking <strong>More Options</strong>. You can change these parameters at a later stage as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Select <strong>Static Code Analysis</strong> for <strong>Analysis Method</strong>. Select <strong>Standard Analysis</strong> for <strong>Analysis Mode</strong> for a standard analysis or <strong>Comprehensive Analysis</strong> for a deep-level, thorough analysis. Click <strong>Browseâ€¦</strong> and select the zip file containing the source code of the application. You can also optionally change the default analysis and mitigation parameters for this application by clicking <strong>More Options</strong>. Finally, click <strong>Upload</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The web page will refresh itself. An Application Box will be shown with the progress of the scan. There are 6 stages:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Building
                </li>
                <li>
                    Compiling
                </li>
                <li>
                    Analyzing (S-1)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Analyzing (S-2)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Analyzing (S-3)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Analyzing (S-4)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Depends on the size and complexity of the application, the scan can take anytime from a few seconds to a few hours to complete. Under most circumstances, a Lucent Sky AVM server is capable of finishing scanning a 100,000 lines application in under 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the scan is completed, the Application Box will show the number of total vulnerabilities, the number of vulnerabilities that
            have been automatically mitigated, as well as the number of those couldn't be automatically mitigated.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>To review the identified vulnerabilities and their Instant Fix</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Go to the Web UI in your browser, and then sign in with your credentials.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the Application Box of the application you want to review. You will be taken to the <strong>Scan Summary</strong> page.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong>Scan Summary</strong> page has three parts: Efficiency Snapshot, Vulnerabilities and Additional Information.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <strong>Efficiency Snapshot</strong> shows the mitigation cost and programming hours saved by automatically mitigating the vulnerabilities in this application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <strong>Vulnerabilities</strong> pie chart shows the distribution of vulnerability categories, as well as the number of vulnerabilities in each category. Clicking a vulnerability slice or a vulnerability box next to the pie chart will take you to the <strong>Vulnerability List</strong> page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Additional Information</strong> shows information about this scan, as well as the number of vulnerabilities compared with the previous scan of the same application.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong>Vulnerability List</strong> page is a list of all the vulnerabilities in that category. Clicking a vulnerability will take you to the <strong>Vulnerability Details</strong> page.
        </li>
        <li>
            The title of the <strong>Vulnerability Details</strong> page shows the category, the file and line number of the vulnerability. The <strong>Statements</strong> shows the flow of the vulnerability in the application, and <strong>Instant Fix</strong> shows how the vulnerability can be mitigated by replacing the source code at the file and line indicated with the Instant Fix.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>To download the secured software of an application of an application</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>

        <li>
            Click the Application Box of the application you want to review. You will be taken to the <strong>Scan Summary</strong> page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Under the Action Bar on the left, click <strong>Mitigate</strong>. In the pop-up dialog, choose if you want to include mitigation information and original source code in the generated source code as comments. The generated source code might be similar to
            <div>
                {% highlight csharp %}
                    Response.Write(HtmlEncode(Request["foo"])); // CWE79 (High); Original source code: Response.Write(Request["Foo"]);
                {% endhighlight %}
            </div>
            where <em>CWE79 (High)</em> is the mitigation information and <em>Original source code: Response.Write(Request["Foo"]);</em> is the original source code.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click <strong>Mitigate</strong> and download to download the secured source code.
        </li>
