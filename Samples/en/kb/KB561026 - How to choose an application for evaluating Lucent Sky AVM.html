        This article contains a checklist that is to help you isolate the best application(s) for evaluating Lucent Sky AVM. Successful use of Lucent Sky AVM requires the application be compatible with our software in addition to being buildable. This list will help you choose an application that has the highest likelihood of an expedient and successful evaluation. Troubleshooting for applications with compatibility issues is available, but can cause delays in evaluations. It is suggested that these applications be tested separately or at a later time to the initial evaluation, which should focus on the substance of Application Vulnerability Mitigation (AVM).

            Web applications will generally have the best results, as they often contain both the most vulnerabilities (by volume) and the most vulnerabilities Lucent Sky AVM supports.

                    .NET 1.0 and 1.1 applications are likely to be incompatible with Lucent Sky AVM without conversion.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some applications use libraries installed by NuGet or installed locally (such as most SDKs) and do not have the referenced libraries in the source code repository. Copy these libraries to the relevant bin directories before uploading the source code to Lucent Sky AVM.

                <li>
                    Applications for which all .jsp, .java, and .tag files compile.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Applications containing all .jar files necessary for compilation in <strong>WEB-INF\lib</strong>. This includes third-party applications that are needed during compilation (such as <strong>hibernate.jar</strong>, <strong>servlet-api.jar</strong>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Applications that are Java 1.6 compliant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Applications that are compatible with Apache Tomcat 7.0 or newer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Applications that contain exactly one <strong>WEB-INF</strong> directory, with a deployment descriptor (web.xml) file located directly underneath that directory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Applications that are a single project (i.e. one module).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Applications that package all external classes in JAR files (as opposed to placing external classes in folders).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Applications for which all source files to be scanned are located in a single root directory that is one of the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For applications in project format, either a <strong>java</strong> or <strong>src</strong> directory immediately under the root directory of the .zip file containing the Java project
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For applications in WAR format, the <strong>WEB-INF\classes</strong> directory (so chosen because it is the default export location for Java source files in Eclipse)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Another directory that is somewhere under the root directory of the .zip file containing the Java project, and is specified by the user and passed in as a scan argument to Lucent Sky AVM.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    Applications that compiles using source files not located under the specified source root directory.

                <li>
                    Applications that includes include precompilation steps that move or copy source files from external locations during the compilation process.

                    Applications using some MVC frameworks (such as CodeIgnitor or Phalcon) that are not fully supported by Lucent Sky AVM yet may have sections that cannot be analyzed and mitigated. Analysis and Instant Fixes will be available for the sections that are supported.
